# Predict real estate price
I've built a regression model to predict real-estate property prices based on bedrooms, bathrooms, acre lot size, street, city, state, and house size.
3 regression models were trained and tested to find the best one out of all, to measure this I utilized the mean absolute error and the R Squared Score.

Step 1: Visualization
Firstly, I checked how the average prices in each state vary, with this graph I was able to notice the trend between states and some states proved to be outliers.
